# python-population-simulation
In this short simulation, I simulated population of a community. The population is affected by several factors listed in the code. Based on these factors, the population changes in a unique fashion which is demonstrated through a matplotlib plot.

Following are the factors that are taken into consideration:

<ul>
  <li>Starting Population</li>
  <li>Infant mortality</li>
  <li>Food</li>
  <li>Fertility x and Fertility y</li>
  <li>Healthcare</li>
  <li>Agriculture</li>
  <li>Chance of disaster</li>
  <li>Age of death</li>
  <li>War Related Deaths</li>
</ul>
